# SigilAGI — Gemma 4 Good Hackathon

Object-to-glyph detection for real-world understanding, symbolic compression, and accessible AI reasoning.

## Project Summary

SigilAGI is an AI system that detects real-world objects, converts them into symbolic glyph representations, and uses Gemma 4 to reason over those glyphs.

Instead of only describing a scene in plain language, SigilAGI creates a structured symbolic layer:

- Object detected
- Object role
- Scene relationship
- Glyph assignment
- Meaning cluster
- Risk or importance level
- Human-readable explanation

## Core Concept

SigilAGI turns visual objects into glyph-based intelligence.

Example:

```text
Detected object: Door
Glyph: ⛩
Meaning: Entry / exit / boundary / transition
Scene role: Possible access point
Reasoning note: This object may define movement, separation, or containment.
Why It Matters
Many AI systems describe images but do not create reusable symbolic structures from them.
SigilAGI introduces an object-to-glyph layer that can help with:
Visual reasoning
Accessibility
Scene memory
Compression
Pattern recognition
Assistive navigation
Field documentation
Human-readable AI traces
Gemma 4 Usage
Gemma 4 is used for:
Interpreting detected objects
Assigning symbolic meaning
Generating glyph-based summaries
Explaining object relationships
Building structured scene reports
Translating glyph clusters into plain English
Supporting agentic reasoning over visual inputs

      "glyph": "☉",
      "meaning": "actor / observer / intent",
      "role": "human subject"
    }
  ],
  "glyph_summary": "☉ near ☏ facing ⛩",
  "plain_english": "A person is near a communication device and positioned toward an entry or boundary point."
}
Safety Design
SigilAGI separates what is detected from what is inferred.
Every report marks:
Detected — objects directly identified from the image
Mapped — glyphs assigned to those objects
Inferred — possible meanings or relationships
Unknown — things the system cannot verify
Human review needed — anything uncertain or high-impact
Demo Flow
User uploads an image.
Object detection identifies objects.
SigilAGI maps each object to a glyph.
Gemma 4 explains the symbolic scene.
The app returns a glyph report and plain-language summary.
